# Some cool Projects to work upon for a good start #

* A community based website to show recommended playlists for movies.For eg - A playlist can be created by any user say XYZ/ action movies and all the people are allowed to add their suggestions to the list. 

* Making a beginner friendly GSOC Website which will be updated and handled by us and the open source community. Where students who have cracked GSOC can share their experience, which will be really helpful for people aiming for GSOC. Basically making a go to platform for every open source enthusiats who wants to get into GSOC.
